# AlphaSmart NEO2 Applets


This repository contains a set of custom applets for the AlphaSmart NEO2, a simple text writing computer running m68k.

These applets are built using the [Betawise library](https://github.com/isotherm/betawise), which provides the necessary tools and os3k functions for developing applets for the NEO/NEO2 hardware. The os3k library, part of the Betawise project, includes low-level functions to interface with the NEO2â€™s hardware, such as display management, keyboard input, and system interrupts.
